Khalid: Try your hand at Lera's shooting gallery. Have you got the fastest air gun in the county? There's a stuffed pumpkin with your name on it.
Khalid: Or wolf down some of Annie's world-famous three-berry pie washed down with a big glug of Miss Ruthie's apple cider. I can practically smell the sweet scent of cinnamon from here.
Khalid: Dancing more your speed? Well, thanks to your efforts Buck and the Boys have gotten their instruments all tuned up, so you'd better bring your best moves cause the floor will be popping!

The Harvest Festival was a complete success. 
People came in from around the county and beyond to meet their neighbors, enjoy the fall, and forget their troubles for one glorious day.
Those who were old enough to remember the before times all agreed that this festival was as good or better as any they'd attended years ago.
Buck and the Boys played all afternoon and into the night. The dance floor was packed the entire time. More than one new romance blossomed to their soundtrack.
To everyone's surprise, Miss Ruthie took home the grand prize at Lera's shooting gallery. Her secret? A twenty-year career in the Marines and fingers kept limber through her knitting.
With the festival running smoothly, Annie finally took a night off. The diner stayed closed while the Mayor celebrated with her community. There was no one happier in the entire county that night.
And Khalid? 
Well, he still plans on moving on. But he'll wait around a little bit. Just long enough to help them get the Festival set up next year...

The Harvest Festival went off without a hitch.
People around town spent the day out and about, meeting their neighbors, enjoying the fall, and snacking down on treats fresh from the oven.
Those who were old enough to remember the before times fondly recalled prior festivals, and told stories about the great hoedowns from long ago.
Buck and the Boys played all afternoon. Happy villagers took to the floor, jumping and shaking to Buck's banjo.
Lera's shooting gallery was by far the most popular attraction, though no one managed to take home the grand prize.
With the festival running smoothly, Annie finally took a night off. She spent her time with her community, helping Miss Ruthie get around and welcoming everyone to town.
And Khalid?

The Harvest Festival was an interesting diversion, though it fell a little short of expectations.
People around town spent an hour or two checking out the attractions and meeting their neighbors, before turning back to their lives.
Those who were old enough to remember the before times shrugged, saying "You can't rebuild something like that."
Buck and the Boys played for a couple of hours in the afternoon. A couple of villagers got up to dance, to the amusement of their neighbors.
Lera's shooting gallery was a popular attraction, but not popular enough to keep her from ending up with a pile of unclaimed prizes.
Annie did not get the chance to enjoy the Festival; she spent the day running around putting out fires and trying to get people excited.
And Khalid? 
His work done, his promise kept, he began reaching out to scrappers who'd be interested in old radio parts. 
A few days later he packed his bag and headed off towards the east, still in search of a home.

The Harvest Festival was a flop.
Most of the attractions saw one, maybe two visitors all day. No one went out of their way to drop by and see what was happening.
Those who were old enough to remember the before times were smug at the failure, laughing to one another "This was never going to work."
Buck and the Boys played for an hour before giving up. Embarrassed and angry, Buck was headed back for the hills before the last chord had died away.
Lera's shooting gallery did attract some visitors, mostly kids who wanted to shoot the air rifle. She quickly tired of playing babysitter, gave them each a prize, and closed up.
Annie started the day running around like crazy, putting out fires and helping Miss Ruthie get set up. 
But by lunchtime, she had given up, and retired with a bottle of wine to the counter in her diner.
And Khalid? 
He left the day of the Festival, heading east. He wouldn't ever return.
