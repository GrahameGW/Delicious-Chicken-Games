Buck: Hi there. It's Buck callin'.
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: Hello Buck. It's great to hear from you.
<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: You bet. Thanks for all the nice things you've been saying about me.
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: You're welcome.
<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: More people have been coming to me for timber, which normally I'd like but it makes it hard to conserve what trees we still have.
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: A tough spot. But it's a good thing you're thinking about the environment as well.
<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: Well, I found a way out. Because you talked about my jackets on your show, folks all over town have been askin' about them.
Buck: I've been able to start a new business selling leather goods. Things couldn't be better.
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: Well that's wonderful to hear. I'm glad we were able to help you out.

<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: Is this that radio clown?
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: ...uh...who is this?
<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: It's Buck. Remember me? You've been trashing me all over the airwaves.
Buck: I have a bone to pick with you.
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: Like how you've been picking on the trees in the valley?
<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: See, you don't even know what you're talking about.
Buck: I've been trying to help everyone survive, working my nails to the bone to get roofs over heads.
Buck: And for your information, I have a tremendous amount of respect for the trees. 
Buck: I practice sustainable logging. I'm the one making sure the tree population remains stable and healthy.
Buck: I plant three trees for every one I chop!
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: ...I'm sorry. I didn't know.
<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: Well, maybe if you stepped out of your little shack for once, you would know.
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: Look, I said I was sorry. 
<<SetSpeaker Buck>>
Buck: I don't want your apologies. It's too late. No one wants me around thanks to you.
Buck: So I'm leaving town. Tonight
<<SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: Buck, waitâ€”

Khalid: ...
Khalid: Buck?
