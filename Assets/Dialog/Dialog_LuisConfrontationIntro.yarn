Luis: What do you think you're doing?
<< SetSpeaker Khalid>> 
Khalid: ...oh. Well, locking up. You are...?
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: What's your business here?
<< SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: Just running the radio. I'm not looking for trouble.
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: Don't waltz in here and act like you know this place well enough to give us news or sell us stuff.
Luis: You're asking for trouble.
<< SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: I'm sorry. Who are you?
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: I asked you that.
<< SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: ...
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: Don't think you can come in here and expect everything will be alright, just 'cause you're a new face.
Luis: We got enough problems as it is, we don't need someone taking up our time with the radio.
Luis: Who even wants to run a dump like this after everything?

Khalid: When I was young, everyone was super nice and friendly.
Khalid: These days, people aren't really like that anymore.
Khalid: I was just...I dunno. I want to reconnect with where my family came from.
Khalid: Maybe help to mend things? Communities work better together.
Khalid: Plus it'd be nice to belong somewhere, for once.
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: You're out of luck.
Luis: What makes you think you can fix something you know nothing about?
Luis: Pack it up and move on. There's nothing for you here.

Khalid: My uncle left this to me. 
Khalid: I was kinda hoping I could make the best of it. It's an opportunity.
Khalid: I'm gonna play some music, run some ads. Maybe earn something and get back on my feet.

Luis: What, you think this town is just made of money?
<< SetSpeaker Khalid>>
Khalid: The town doesn't fundâ€”
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: People like you are sick, taking from people who don't have anything.
Luis: There's no money here. Nothing for you pal.

<< SetSpeaker Khalid>> 
Khalid: Alright! I can tell you don't have the best opinion of this whole...thing.
Khalid: But Annie? Your mayor? She approves. It's as much her idea as mine.
Khalid: So who knows? I might not be all that bad.
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: *snorts* Our mayor? There's a reason why we've only had one mayor for the last decade.
Luis: Nothing good ever happens here.
<< SetSpeaker Khalid>> 
Khalid: ...
<< SetSpeaker Luis>> 
Luis: Run the station. Fine. But the least you can do is know your audience. 
<< SetSpeaker Khalid>> 
Khalid: ...was he even listening to the broadcast?
