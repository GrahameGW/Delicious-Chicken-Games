Khalid: Try your hand at Lera's shooting gallery. Have you got the fastest air gun in the county? There's a stuffed pumpkin with your name on it.
Khalid: Or wolf down some of Annie's world-famous three-berry pie washed down with a big glug of Miss Ruthie's apple cider. I can practically smell the sweet scent of cinnamon from here.
Khalid: Dancing more your speed? Well, thanks to your efforts Buck and the Boys have gotten their instruments all tuned up, so you'd better bring your best moves cause the floor will be popping!

The Harvest Festival was a complete success. 
People came in from around the county and beyond to meet their neighbors, enjoy the fall, and forget their troubles for one glorious day.
Those who were old enough to remember the before times all agreed that this festival was as good or better as any they'd attended years ago.
Buck and the Boys played all afternoon and into the night. The dance floor was packed the entire time. More than one new romance blossomed to their soundtrack.
To everyone's surprise, Miss Ruthie took home the grand prize at Lera's shooting gallery. Her secret? A twenty-year career in the Marines and fingers kept limber through her knitting.
With the festival running smoothly, Annie finally took a night off. The diner stayed closed while the Mayor celebrated with her community. There was no one happier in the entire county that night.
And Khalid? 
Well, he still plans on moving on. But he'll wait around a little bit. Just long enough to help them get the Festival set up next year...
