Khalid: Try your hand at Lera's shooting gallery. Have you got the fastest air gun in the county? There's a stuffed pumpkin with your name on it.
Khalid: Or wolf down some of Annie's world-famous three-berry pie washed down with a big glug of Miss Ruthie's apple cider. I can practically smell the sweet scent of cinnamon from here.
Khalid: Dancing more your speed? Well, thanks to your efforts Buck and the Boys have gotten their instruments all tuned up, so you'd better bring your best moves cause the floor will be popping!
