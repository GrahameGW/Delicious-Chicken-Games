Khalid: Everyone I've spoken to has said that Buck is a wonderful addition to our little town.
Khalid: He goes out of his way to provide strong, quality lumber to rebuild the homes of our citizens.
Khalid: No more sleeping under re-purposed scrap metal!
Khalid: I've slept in plenty of those shelters, and they get so cold at night.
Khalid: We're all so grateful to Buck for everything he's doneâ€”plus no more fear of tetnaus!
Khalid: Three cheers for Buck!

Khalid: Look, everyone I've spoken to says he's a nice guy that goes out of his way to help them.
Khalid: But there are plenty of grumbles too. Buck, I say this as your friendly radio broadcaster:
Khalid: Stop destroying trees. We need them for our precious oxygen, and to keep the wind from racing down the valley.
Khalid: And in case you hadn't noticed, there aren't that many trees around these days.
Khalid: With every tree you cut, you suffocate us just a little bit more.
Khalid: I know you're a lumberjack, but you seriously should consider switching professions.
Khalid: The Buck must stop here!
